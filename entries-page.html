                    APOLOGETICALLY ME Q AND A   --  <i>October 30th, 2025</i><br>
                    <br>
                    Q: What is one thing you made that you are proud of? <br>
                    A: In elementary school I had a project where you had to make a model of a historical building/place, and I chose Tower Bridge. 
                    If you don’t know what Tower Bridge is picture two towers with a bridge connecting them. The materials of choice were popsicle sticks and globs of hot glue. 
                    The outcome was a 1:1 replica of the bridge itself. My classmates gawked as I wagoned it in. I don’t really remember who came up with the idea to make the draw bridge actually draw but it was most likely my Dad. 
                    With some tools and passion he made the bridge walk, breathe,  sing, and even draw! Sure, I stole from a small artist and pasted my name right across that project and bathed in the glory, but it was pretty obvious I was not the mind behind the mechanics. 
                    If you ever go to that bridge just know that a better one once existed. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q: Imagine that you could choose when and how you die. What age would you like to die and how would you like to go? <br>
                    A: I like to think that my time is up at 50. Maybe saying “I like to think” is strange and gives the wrong impression but imagine this: You’re 51. 
                    Not as fun as fifty is it? The cause of death would be slipping in someone’s spilled drink on a dance floor hitting my head on floor and with hazy sight 
                    the glimmer of the disco ball sparkles in my eyes.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q:What do you know isn’t real, but want badly for it to exist? <br>
                    A: Cat aliens. The kittens eat octopus tentacles and the older cats meow the notes of the cat piano children’s toy. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q:What is the greatest physical pain you’ve ever felt? <br>
                    A: I had this dream one night where I was stabbed in the lower abdomen.  I felt the blade go in and the warmth of the blood on my skin. Right after being stabbed I shot up awake and held the spot of the wound. 
                    One of the coolest feelings I’ve ever felt. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q: In what ways are you stubborn? <br>
                    A: When my mind makes a decision there is very little hope of talking me out of it. Example: I decided that I wanted the under-dye hair style. My hair is naturally curly and I was straightening my hair on a daily basis. 
                    Now think of the damage bleaching it would add on top of that. My Mom told me that it was a bad idea, but nothing was moving me away from the vision. Well, I ended up dying it back to my natural hair colour and was left with absolutely 
                    nothing to work with. I really regretted it and with a heavy head had to admit to my Mom she was right. But, the best way to learn is from your mistakes. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q: What do you think happens after we die, if anything? <br>
                    A: I like to imagine it being like a bear heading to hibernation. You enter a cave, like down in a soft bed, close your eyes, and drift into a warm slumber. To me the idea of living eternally some form of afterlife world is a nightmare. 
                    Knowing the end is the end gives me great comfort and more reason to make the most of what I’m given now. It would also make the saying: “you only live once” false, which I don’t like. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q: What is something you and I disagree on? <br>
                    A: Maybe the idea of god, maybe what colour foods we would eat if we were only allowed to eat one colour, probably what the moon dreams of when she goes to sleep, but I think we would agree that mice should be given little hats.
