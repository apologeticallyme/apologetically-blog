                    I CAN'T COME AND SEE YOU BECAUSE ITS DARK AND COLD OUTSIDE -- <i>December 8th, 2025</i> <br>
                    <br>
                    I am pumped full of caffeine and yet I yawn every five minutes. Last night I think I was suffering the consequences of the caffeine surplus because I felt strange. 
                    <i>Strange how?</i> You might be wondering well fortunately for you I don’t know how to describe it. It’s kinda like if the air around you stood still, you’re moving at what you 
                    think is a regular pace when in reality you just kinda look like a freak attempting to moonwalk. I found this one album (it’s actually a compilation) off of a Rate Your Music 
                    list that has an alien on the cover. Aliens have taken over my brain and it was gonna happen sooner or later. I know RYM isn’t highly thought of. I see it as being the wikipedia to 
                    teachers in  a music nerds context. I don’t actually read the reviews what I do is go shopping in the user made lists and check out the albums with covers I find cool. It’s a testament 
                    to my habit of judging a book by its cover because if your album art is ugly I am not touching the music inside even if it’s a hidden gem. I have my standards and I will hold you to them. <br>
                    <br>
                    As for linear algebra…. Not much is going on. Panic hasn’t set in but it’s because I’m just so absolutely tired. I already swore myself in to retake the class. If I were not me and I 
                    was giving myself advice I would tell her to keep going. You never know what you never know the future in your hands and your mind is capable of more than you can imagine. Did that help 
                    you too? Im rambling my apologies

                    NOW YOU SEE ME NOW YOU DON’T -- <i>November 20th, 2025</i> <br>
                    <br>
                    I have a dilemma. Do I delete all my social media pages, or do I keep them? <br>
                    <br>
                    I’ve been on the internet for a long long time. I remember spending my summer days staying inside watching YouTube during the summer of grade 3, 
                    setting up my first instagram account at age 10, playing flash games on the family computer with my sister (this lasted for a while), etc. I mean, me and the 
                    rest of the people in my generation were born into the age of the internet. Although it was a bit different compared to now in the sense that an iPad wasn’t placed 
                    into my lap the second I developed basic motor skills. <br>
                    <br>
                    As a result of my long-time internet use came an impressive portfolio of internet drama knowledge and an ever increasing screen time. Hours upon hours spent with eyes 
                    stuck to a screen, and I’m pretty embarrassed about how bad it got to be at certain points. I’m going to skip over talking about why a high-screen time is bad as well as 
                    elaborating on why social media is harmful because I assume you know the reasons yourselves. <br>
                    <br>
                    The rock that broke the mirror was a moment I had while sitting on the train sometime last week. I looked around at the other passengers in the carriage and every single 
                    one of them had their necks craned and eyes glued to the screen in their hands. I don’t know what their day was like before hand and whether this was their first time in hours 
                    being able to check their messages, or have a moment to relax and tune into their current watch, but this strange feeling began to loom over me. Have we reached a point of no return? <br>
                    <br>
                    The internet is no longer what it used to be. It’s now corporate ridden, becoming more and more hateful, and made to keep your attention. Brains are becoming mushy and cases of social anxiety 
                    rise each day. Who I’m becoming/want to become cannot be cultivated on poor soil. I want to be able to think without influence, I want to spend my time indulging in hobbies I enjoy, and to simply 
                    put it want a break.  And I’ve reached my conclusion. <br>
                    <br>
                    I could say more, but I don’t really want to. Thanks for helping me figure this out

                    <br>
                    I easily slip into daydreaming about my ideal life, self, and world. I’m reluctant to face the fact that I could be somewhere else if I had let go of my ego and faced the unknown. <br>
                    “No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun” <br>
                    A confession on my end: I’m doing everything completely wrong right now. This is not where I’m meant to be and I need to go. <br>
                    <br>
                    So, I hereby vow to do everything in my power to become/do everything I want to be/do. I will not submit myself to a life of misery to appease someone other than me. 
                    I’m only given this one life and the biggest sin of all is to waste it. <br>
                    <br>

                    APOLOGETICALLY ME Q AND A   --  <i>October 30th, 2025</i><br>
                    <br>
                    Q: What is one thing you made that you are proud of? <br>
                    A: In elementary school I had a project where you had to make a model of a historical building/place, and I chose Tower Bridge. 
                    If you don’t know what Tower Bridge is picture two towers with a bridge connecting them. The materials of choice were popsicle sticks and globs of hot glue. 
                    The outcome was a 1:1 replica of the bridge itself. My classmates gawked as I wagoned it in. I don’t really remember who came up with the idea to make the draw bridge actually draw but it was most likely my Dad. 
                    With some tools and passion he made the bridge walk, breathe,  sing, and even draw! Sure, I stole from a small artist and pasted my name right across that project and bathed in the glory, but it was pretty obvious I was not the mind behind the mechanics. 
                    If you ever go to that bridge just know that a better one once existed. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q: Imagine that you could choose when and how you die. What age would you like to die and how would you like to go? <br>
                    A: I like to think that my time is up at 50. Maybe saying “I like to think” is strange and gives the wrong impression but imagine this: You’re 51. 
                    Not as fun as fifty is it? The cause of death would be slipping in someone’s spilled drink on a dance floor hitting my head on floor and with hazy sight 
                    the glimmer of the disco ball sparkles in my eyes.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q:What do you know isn’t real, but want badly for it to exist? <br>
                    A: Cat aliens. The kittens eat octopus tentacles and the older cats meow the notes of the cat piano children’s toy. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q:What is the greatest physical pain you’ve ever felt? <br>
                    A: I had this dream one night where I was stabbed in the lower abdomen.  I felt the blade go in and the warmth of the blood on my skin. Right after being stabbed I shot up awake and held the spot of the wound. 
                    One of the coolest feelings I’ve ever felt. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q: In what ways are you stubborn? <br>
                    A: When my mind makes a decision there is very little hope of talking me out of it. Example: I decided that I wanted the under-dye hair style. My hair is naturally curly and I was straightening my hair on a daily basis. 
                    Now think of the damage bleaching it would add on top of that. My Mom told me that it was a bad idea, but nothing was moving me away from the vision. Well, I ended up dying it back to my natural hair colour and was left with absolutely 
                    nothing to work with. I really regretted it and with a heavy head had to admit to my Mom she was right. But, the best way to learn is from your mistakes. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q: What do you think happens after we die, if anything? <br>
                    A: I like to imagine it being like a bear heading to hibernation. You enter a cave, like down in a soft bed, close your eyes, and drift into a warm slumber. To me the idea of living eternally some form of afterlife world is a nightmare. 
                    Knowing the end is the end gives me great comfort and more reason to make the most of what I’m given now. It would also make the saying: “you only live once” false, which I don’t like. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q: What is something you and I disagree on? <br>
                    A: Maybe the idea of god, maybe what colour foods we would eat if we were only allowed to eat one colour, probably what the moon dreams of when she goes to sleep, but I think we would agree that mice should be given little hats.
