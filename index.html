                    Choose Life. Choose a job. Choose a career. Choose a family. Choose a fucking big television, choose washing machines, cars, compact disc players and electrical tin openers. Choose good health, low cholesterol, and dental insurance. 
                     fixed interest mortgage repayments. Choose a starter home. Choose your friends. Choose leisurewear and matching luggage. Choose a three-piece suit on hire purchase in a range of fucking fabrics. Choose DIY and wondering who the 
                    fuck you are on Sunday morning. Choose sitting on that couch watching mind-numbing, spirit-crushing game shows, stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth. Choose rotting away at the end of it all, pissing your last in a miserable home, 
                    nothing more than an embarrassment to the selfish, fucked up brats you spawned to replace yourselves. Choose your future. Choose life... But why would I want to do a thing like that? I chose not to choose life. I chose somethin' else. And the reasons? 
                    There are no reasons. Who needs reasons when you've got heroin?
                    The truth is that I'm a bad person. But, that's gonna change - I'm going to change. This is the last of that sort of thing. Now I'm cleaning up and I'm moving on, going straight and choosing life. I'm looking forward to it already. I'm gonna be just like you.

                    One of the worst things that I do is say that I'll do something and never do it. But I slightly proved myself wrong with the creation of this site!
                    At the age of ______ I am now a proud domain owner! Typing in my credit card details and seeing the payment successfully process is comparable to a mother holding their baby for the first time.
                    It also feels like moving out and being without your parents. This is my place where I can talk about whatever I want, I have no restrictions or anyone in my ear, and I am the sole creator of my reality. 
                    On a walk one day I mentally wrote what I was going to put here. Iâ€™ve forgotten most of it by now but the main idea is that this site is going to grow alongside me. Hand in hand and till and death do us part. 
                    Have fun walking around my mind but tread carefully, I might get a headache.
